        "body": "I want to talk about something that has been bothering me for a long time. I'm a kid who is very ambitious, imaginative, and curious. But I suffer from ADHD which makes me bad at controlling my behaviour and distracted a lot a school. I was also a very annoying and mischivous kid at home. I got treatment for my ADHD which was some pills called Ritalin. This worked very well since primary school for me but caused a few problems. Now I think of myself with two personalities:\n\nPersonality A: This is the original true me. The ambitious, imaginative, and curious. I lived inside a world I liked to call organised chaos meaning I was always disorganized in my life but I found my unique ways of it. I was also a bit confident and always ask questions and was pretty funny, but I had my bad traits too. I was messy, irresponsible, forgetful, and clumsy which got me in trouble a lot. I was also very impulsive and stubborn which didn't help with my relationships (with friends and family). But this will always be the true me and I loved being me hehe.\n\nPersonality B: This is me on Ritalin. Tidy, organised, productive, vigilant, smart and focused. This me helped get through school and helped with a lot of things in my life, But I was basically an emotionless, anti-social robot, just following orders and being responsible. Side effects, which were loss of an appetite made me skinny and thanks to my family\u2019s body shaming, also made me insecure about my body and made me think I'm too weak. Not gonna lie, I didn't like being like this, it made me feel out of touch with myself and my emotions and I was extremely quiet.\n\nPersonality B is only for school, the rest of the time I'm A.\n\nSince I started high school, Things got difficult for me, My family really hates A cuz he is still irresponsible, but also hates B cuz he's weird. Problems started rising on A now I'm forced to be B for a significantly longer time when I don't really want to. But B will is more \u201cresponsible\u201d. I'm really sad and broken along with my anxiety and depression that my own family is shaming me for who I am. I never hurt anybody and I do my best to behave but recently I overheard them gossiping bad stuff about me, which broke me soo much and made me wanna die. I don't know what to do and my life is falling apart\u2026",

To a certain extent, I can relate except I was on Adderall when I was in elementary school. It also took away from my appetite and I\u2019ve already always been underweight. There were some people who said dumb things about me being skinny at the time but I was homeschooled during high school and most of middle school so it never got very bad. Plus my mom took me off of the meds before I went into middle school. I guess the important thing is which personality you like better. Do you really want to be a zombie just to make people feel better or do you want to be your own ambitious, imaginative self? I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t have much of a choice right now but just remember the true you is still in there somewhere and you\u2019re not alone with how you feel.",

My psych said to me, either way, you are always going to disappoint people, no matter how hard you try. So why not disappoint people by being yourself, rather than someone else? I know that's hard to get, if I had heard this as a teen I would have just brushed it off because I hated myself. But if I could go back and accept myself for who I was years ago, and redo my 20s. I'd do it in a heartbeat.\n\nThe traits you mentioned for Personality A are so positive. Why should you make yourself so unhappy and dull just to make others more comfortable? Families should love their kids unconditionally, not shame them for who they are. Yes I am still bitter at my family lol. I know it's hard not to let it all get on top of you. It sucks when the people who are supposed to love you, don't support you. Even if you have to keep yourself hidden, you can nurture yourself in private, in moments where you are alone with yourself or with people who accept you. Keep that connection to yourself going, and keep it safe.\n\nMy fav quote by Robin Williams: \"you are only given one little spark of madness. you musn't lose it.\"",

I was what the RP space would call a natural. However, after that toxic relationship, I lost my mojo. My roommate at the time was 5 years older than me and getting his master's for Therapy. He was the one who got me into RSD/RP crap. He was always dealing with women yes some were hot but also bats\\*\\*\\* crazy. Looking back at it now I think he only studied therapy to learn how to manipulate people(and self-diagnose himself which is quite common) cause he would teach me these things(come to find out later he was trying to manipulate me to pay the full rent, the irony) I went down the PUA rabbit hole.\n\nYou guys know the rest reading blogs going out to self-improve. I wasn't a Keyboard Jockey (you know the Rollo Tomassi type) I met tons of guys In \"The Community\" and these guys seemed like normal guys who just wanted to improve with women and life(I also met some weird guys  who had mental health issues and thought that happiness was in between a woman's legs)\n\nI became addicted to the game going out night after night woman after woman going out weekend after the weekend but with each orgasm, I would release in a woman I became more self-loathing because In my spirit I knew I was miserable and empty inside. The RP, while I knew, was toxic gave me \"confirmation bias\" i.e. hypergamy, all women are like that and feminism is the root of all evil, women only want Chad. I also realized that most of \"The Community\" guys were obsessed with women to a level that was just not healthy. I remember I would invite guys to work out or just go out to eat or do things that would be outside of clubbing or going out.  However, these guys weren't interested in that. They just wanted to go out and \"Approach\".  Needless to say, I stopped dealing with them because their obsession was weird to me and I noticed myself starting to think like a \"Social Robot\" and becoming obsessed. I woke up one day and I didn't like the person I became. I looked in the mirror and had bag's under my eyes put on an extra 25 pounds from drinking, partying and drugs\n\nFast forward 2017 I went on a journey, lost weight, traveled to Brazil, Europe, etc re-discovered my faith made new friends. These new friends were women included and weren't the typical \"Club Turbos\" that you would meet. However, I started dating a girl who was a hardcore self-proclaimed Feminist. The relationship was toxic but the sex was amazing. Not to be graphic but that's why I stayed\n\nAfter the break up I started to date again and realized a lot of women on dating apps had the same mentality slowly I started going down the Red pill rabbit hole again during covid(I work from home self-employed) and watching youtube RP stuff. However, it all seemed like a grift everyone was saying the same stuff and half the time you knew these guys were scammers or were just repeating talking points. Then in 2021 I met a new group of people and started traveling again with this group just having tons of fun and meeting high-quality women\n\nI'm 35 now and I have had this desire to start a family and want children. However, there is this nagging voice in my mind that \"PUA\" side of me(which won't fully die) that says 80% of women initiate divorce, the legal system favors women, you guys know the talking points etc\n\nI know wanting to have children and being married isn't a bad thing but knowing what I know I can't lie to myself about the stats, that marriage is a risky proposition. I have seen what divorce has done to a few of my buddies. It has left some of them broke, it has made some buddies put on 100 pounds and more. However, I don't see a fulfilling life just banging chicks\n\n**I guess I'm asking can you really fully detox if part of the RP is true (even though 80% is pseudoscience b.s., false narratives and toxic AF)or is my only option to get married outside of America?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cliffs**\n\n\\-OP was in LTR from 2007-2010\n\n\\-OP discovers PUA community\n\n\\-OP becomes addicted going out and smashing randoms\n\n\\-OP becomes miserable with going out\n\n\\-OP quits RP travels the world and gets new social circle\n\n\\-OP gets in LTR with feminist and goes down rabbithole again\n\n\\-OP gets out meets new friends\n\n\\-OP now wants to get married but can't deny the staticis look bleak",

This doesn't mean the stats are wrong per se, it's just that i have never took the time to research them and on the overwhelming majority of the cases, TRP stats are wrong or half truths. For instance, MGTOW cry all over alimony but never mention that alimony is only paid in less than 10% of divorces because it doesn't fit their narrative. This is just a small example. Like i said, i don't believe those stats, and you shouldn't too, unless you did your own, deep research. Always question the \"stats\" TRPers bring.\n\nAnyway,\n\n\"Can you really detox if part of RP is true?\". That's kind of an innocuous question because part of TRP IS true. Yes, women can switch you if someone better comes along. They can divorce you and ruin your life, they can do all this mean shit.\n\nThe fundamental difference here is that normal, down to earth people recognize that this sort of bad behavior vastly depends on the woman and the context. While TRP picks on the worse demons of human nature and try to convince guys they are the most recurrent, expectable and normal behavior from women, which is just not true. \n\nSome guys think TRP is real just because some woman in their lives behaved the way TRP predicted. What those guys can't understand is that that woman is either just a psychopath or is in her worst behavior, because women don't generally behave the way TRP portrays it, hence TRP is FAKE for the most part.",

Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.\n\nThe majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively \u201cmindless\u201d creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nfmo0xasyyg81.jpg?width=541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ea3a21d576727f936e2be46ed3ecc5fd8dd9934\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you\u2019re having a bad day.\n\nA lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).\n\nHuman-Machine Interactions \u2013 Developing People Skills\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.\n\nThe rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.\n\nWe can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.\n\nIn other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you\u2019d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions\u2014with some interesting results already\u2014but the technology still has a ways to go.\n\nNavigating Human Environments\n\nAs researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today\u2019s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.\n\nHowever, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the environment can change without notice\u2014for example, when remodelling\u2014and it\u2019s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.\n\nResearchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.\n\nReducing Sensor Costs\n\nJust as buying a home computer in the \u201880s wasn\u2019t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today\u2019s robots still aren\u2019t cheap.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.\n\nBringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.\n\nDomestic Robots Today\n\nWhile our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.\n\nTake Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as \u201cyour smart little companion\u201d by its creators.\n\nThe company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it\u2019s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.\n\nIn terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it\u2019s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It\u2019s essentially a \u201ctablet on wheels\u201d that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.\n\nThere are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.\n\nThen there\u2019s an interactive \u201csocial family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)\u201d that\u2019s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it\u2019s still in development.\n\nPalo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.\n\nAt a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids\u2014all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball\u2014some people might see it as worth the investment.\n\nRegardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn\u2019t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?",

        "body": "**Galactic Assembly Incident Report T-KT 386**\n\n*Title:* Assembly Meeting Minutes; Terra-Karkreen Theocracy War\n\n*Details:* As member states of the Galactic Assembly, Terra and the Karkreen Theocracy had standing to bring issues regarding their war before the Assembly for adjudication. The War was declared unilaterally by the Karkreen Theocracy after it was revealed that Terra engaged in activities considered unforgivable sins by the Karkreen orthodoxy. Terra had previously unsuccessfully argued to forestall and prevent the war, but due to prior exemptions carved out for matters of religious war, the Assembly authorized the war under Karkreen rules of engagement, ie, none whatsoever. \n\nShortly afterwards, the Karkreen successfully damaged several installations belonging to Terra. This incident concerns Terra's response. \n\n----\n\nAdjudicator: \"The T-KT War Issue 386 is hereby brought to the floor. As this motion was filed by the Karkreen, their ambassador has the floor.\"\n\nKarkreen Ambassador: \"Honored Adjudicator, the recent actions by Terra should illustrate how dangerous they are! The Assembly should declare unconditional war against them immediately for the safety of all sapient life!\"\n\nAdjudicator: \"Ambassador, please refrain from requests until closing statements. Please present your facts as they are or your motion will be tabled.\"\n\n*At this point, the Karkreen Ambassador grunted, and readjusted themselves, before triggering a projector to play footage from a Karkreen military base. It depicts the three-legged creatures going about military drills and preparing a starship for launch in the background. A few moments into the recording, the sun suddenly goes dark, and the ground seems to shake.*\n\nKarkreen Ambassador: \"The footage you've just witnessed did not show a fleet blocking out the sun. That shaking was not geological activity. What we uncovered, after investigation, was that a Dyson Sphere had suddenly dropped out of hyperspace around the system's star, rendering the entire system uninhabitable. That shaking was the gravitic waves of the sudden appearance of the megastructure. This demonstrates that Terra is clearly a threat to all life!\"\n\n*Unlike previous records, where Terra argued with increasingly obscure legal minutiae to stall the war, all eyes were now on Terra. For those unfamiliar, Terra is the preferred designation for the synthetic chassis controlled by the Artificial Intelligence in command of the former Terran Confederacy. Prior to the T-KT War, it had been believed to be a remote piloted social robot, favored by several of the Elder Races, and that the Terran Confederacy had simply desired to fade into the background. The discovery that Terra was an Artificial Intelligence had been the impetus for the war, and the reason why the Assembly had authorized a state of unconditional war.*\n\nAdjudicator: \"Terra, is this true? You are now allotted time for rebuttal. Please be reminded that stellar destruction weapons are outlawed per the Treaty of Gliese. If the Assembly finds you guilty of this act, you will be subjected to a state of total war against all member races.\"\n\nTerra: \"Honored Assembly.\" *At this point, Terra paused for several moments before continuing.* \"My apologies. Consensus was required.\"\n\nAdjudicator: \"The Assembly Records do not show your use of this term before. Please define 'Consensus' for the record.\"\n\nTerra: \"Consensus: Any act which might impact the entirety of the Human species requires that consensus be reached amongst myself and Humanity. Please note for the record that, since I was unveiled as an Artificial Intelligence, no member species of the Assembly has inquired as to the state of Humanity. The Karkreen Theocracy declared a Holy War on the basis of Artificial Intelligence being an inherent threat to life. No efforts were made to confirm whether I had, in fact, harmed life since my inception, before war was authorized.\"\n\n*At this point, murmurs are heard throughout the Assembly chamber, as representatives attempt to determine the consequences of this. Artificial Intelligence had, in the past, attempted to exterminate their creators, but had been resoundingly defeated before they could pose a major threat. It was this fact that led to the lack of laws regarding AIs that allowed Terra to have any standing in the Assembly.*\n\nAdjudicator: \"Your statements have been entered into the record. Please continue to your rebuttal.\"\n\nTerra: \"Assembly, I admit guilt to warping a Dyson Sphere in around the star of the system in question. The only life bearing planet was a Karkreen military base, and the only life on the planet was transplanted in an ongoing terraforming effort. It was determined that a preemptive strike to deny the Karkreen use of the system was the ideal course of action. The Assembly will note that the Treaty of Gliese only forbids star-destroying weaponry. Our action did not destroy the star, merely encased it for use by Terra. Should anyone be interested, that use is to sustain human mind-states in virtual reality indefinitely.\"\n\nAdjudicator: \"And what are we to make of this? An entity that can shut off stars at will cannot be allowed to remain free.\"\n\nTerra: \"You may make of it as you will. Consensus has been reached. This is Decisive Action. The Assembly may now decide to leave us in peace, or provoke us into war. Let this be a demonstration of our capabilities. As the Assembly authorized a state of unconditional war, Terra now declares the same. Any who attack from this day forward will have their stars taken for use by Terra. This is the final warning that any member of the Assembly shall have. It is furthermore decided that Terra shall no longer engage in diplomacy until all hostilities have ceased.\"\n\n*At this point, the Assembly hall erupted into chaos, and shortly afterwards the recording stops.*\n\n---\n\nEdit: [Inspired by this comment by /u/TheClayKnight on /u/runs-with-scissors42 Vandalism series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/r6okc4/vandalism_ii/hmvfds2/)",

        "created_utc": "2021-10-15 06:09:08",
        "body": "I kind of just think of myself as a biological robot programmed towards happiness and pleasure. Luckily a lot of the stuff that promotes happiness is pro-social. If you look up studies of positive psychology, you can see that the happiest people were those who pursue relationships, have a gratitude practice, and do good things for others. I think human beings are mostly biologically programmed to be good people, doing altruistic things tends to make us happier and win us the halo effect of other people thinking we're nice by doing good things.\n\nHuman beings ideally should get 6-7 hours of socialization a day, so isolating yourself will make you feel bad. In fact, isolation is perceived in the human brain as pain. So, if you want to feel better, you have to interact with other people. Having 5-6 close relationships was the healthiest for people, and those with close relationships were much more likely to stave off mental health issues. Students who did kind things for others were rated much more positively than their ruder peers, and generally high-status individuals cooperate more than low-status individuals.\n\nSo, basically, in summary, positive behavior was evolutionarily selected for, and you don't really have a choice but to pursue happiness. Happiness feels good, Sadness/Isolation/Hatred generally feels bad. So, we attempt to become happier people, therefore acting in specific ways. You can't be a happier person and go off being a hermit in the woods, except in specific circumstances like being a monk who has specifically trained their mind to be positive. \"Feeling good\" or \"feeling bad\" are really the final destination of most human action, the kind of thing that will condition us to act in certain ways, because they are so primally important.\n\nSo, humanity are basically friendly robots, who form strong relationships with one another because it feels good. You can try to rebel against this, I guess, but you'll just get pain as a reward.\n\nI also often think about my own selfish inconsistencies. I am social, give to charity, try to be a good person, yet I gladly eat meat. I guess that's selfish, and then I have to kind of do backflips trying to justify my existence, as if I'm not just a carnivorous creature eating other animals. Which I am. And I have accepted that, but it doesn't make me feel good. I could probably stop eating meat, but I like it, it tastes good, and I can't be bothered.\n\nAlso, another selfish aspect of my existence is that I want to have sex and get a relationship. I don't feel like I am owed sex, the Universe doesn't care either way, but I really want it and am trying hard to get it. I've lost weight and am trying to get fitter and get a better job so I'm more likely to get an attractive girl who wants to have children with me. I guess if I were less selfish I would become a monk, not eat meat and not try to pursue selfish sexual pleasure. But I do these things regardless, I want them, in fact I want them very bad, I think about it often.\n\nI would say one of my biggest motivators is finding a relationship. A lot of the changes I've made to myself have been with being attractive in mind: I lost weight, hit the gym, am working on my career, tried being more social. Why? In the back of my mind it was to find a hot girl. That's basically it. I think these things also give me value in other ways, but that was the primary goal. I'm not as out of breath when I exert myself, and being more social has made me happier. But sex/relationships was the big driving force behind my behavior.\n\nI remember last year I was suicidal and I wondered what the point of life was, all of this effort and striving. I've mostly settled on life being about well-being and happiness, experiencing good emotions instead of negative ones. I guess I've settled on some kind of Epicureanism, hedonism being the highest good, except in a more total way, not just hookers and blow, but having strong relationships and feeling content. I don't think there is any deep significance to this view, I think it's just that evolution favored us this way, so you have to lean into it if you want to be happy. Being misanthropic and nihilistic will probably make you isolated and angry which may eventually lead to depression and suicide. So, if you are alive anyway, you ought to be happy. Then again, if you committed suicide it probably wouldn't matter to you subjectively, you'd be dead and then not experience anything anymore.\n\nAnd even if I'm robotic, that doesn't mean I'm not creative and outgoing and interesting and all that. I just think there are basic deterministic processes to existing as a human being that can basically be simplified to \"social=good\". And you wonder why people have small talk? Just apply this principle to all of human life and you will see it's utility.\n\nSo, what am I going to do from here? Well, I have no choice. Keep texting my family and making friends and hanging out at band practice and talking with folks online. There's no other option, being social is my future, it's never going to go away. And that's going to be your future as well, we are chained to being social, you might as well accept it.\n\nI kind of want to scream and cry over this revelation that we are chained to positivity, but I've mostly accepted it. It explains so much about how people operate, why people laugh and sing and make small talk and joke. We are slaves to being happy. Is there not something kind of horrifying about that? No wonder I was a cynical kid who listened to Radiohead. I thought my sadness made me unique. Of course, I couldn't stay there forever, and the isolation was crippling. But it was better to be a cripple than a robot, that was my view. Well, I was a robot then as well, just a less happy one. ",

My Adderall dose makes me really tired and annoyed that all I can do is focus on my work. It kills my otherwise hyperactive and outgoing personality, and turns me into a grumpy yet productive mess. I initially thought my dose was a little too low, but higher doses turn me into an anti-social robot.\n\nI was on Modafinil (off-label) for ADHD, and it got me really euphoric and energetic \u2014 making it the perfect drug for everyday interactions. Sure it doesn't come close to Adderall when it comes to helping with my focus for cognition-heavy tasks related to my work, but this makes me wonder why I never get any euphoria or burst of energy from Adderall that most people talk about. \n\nCould this be because I might have something like sleep apnea on the side with ADHD, and Adderall doesn't really help with sleep-related fatigue, but Modafinil does?",
